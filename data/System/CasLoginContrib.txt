---++ Usage

Uses JA-SIG [[Wikipedia:Central_Authentication_Service][CAS]] Single Sign On infrastructure for foswiki authentication.

If the user has already authenticated at the SSO, the user will not need to enter their password again.

This Authentication infrastructure can be coupled together with an external 
User mapper such as Foswiki:Extensions.LdapContrib, allowing foswiki to 'outsource' its user details.

To activate it, you will specify =Foswiki::LoginManager::CasLogin= in the 
security setup section of [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]], and set the ={CAS}= specific settings.

---+++ Notes
Don't forget to get get the CAS server's =https= =ssl= certificate, and add its path into =configure= : in the ={CAS}{CAFile}= setting.

(the =cipher RC4-SHA= can be removed if you're not getting the problem described below)
<verbatim>
openssl  s_client -cipher RC4-SHA   -connect jasig.home.org.au:8443 2>&1 | sed -n '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/,/-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ p' > ../foswiki/core/jasig.crt
</verbatim>

---++++ OpenSSL issue

If you get the following error, add =--sslv3= to the command line, and to the expert setting below
<verbatim>
sven@quiet:~/src/AuthCAS$ curl -I --insecure https://jasig.home.org.au:8443/login
curl: (35) error:14077438:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert internal error
</verbatim>

If you successfully log into the CAS server, and then get returned to the foswiki with a url containing a =?ticket= parameter but are not logged in to foswiki, you may be hitting an OpenSSL issue due to your CAS server's cipher fallbacks. You bay be able to solve this by using the *EXPERT* setting found in =configure= :
={CAS}{SSL_version}=. Set the value to =SSLv3=.
